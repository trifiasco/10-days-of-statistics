### Mean = SUM(x1,x2,...xn)/n

### Median = midpoint value of a data set.
	1.sort the list.
	2. For an odd sample size, this is the middle element of the sorted sample; for an even sample size, this is the average of the  middle elements of the sorted sample

### Mode = The element(s) that occur most frequently in a data set.

### Precision = the number of significant digit.

### Scale  = the number of significant digit to the right of the decimal point

### Weighted Mean =
	given x[] = x1, x2, ... xn and
	      w[] = w1, w2, ... wn

	weighted mean = sum(x1*w1 + x2*w2 + ... + xn*wn)/ sum(w1,w2.., wn)
