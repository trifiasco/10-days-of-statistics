### Quartile
The quartiles of an ordered data set are the 3 points that split the data set into 4 equal groups.

Q1: The first quartile is the middle number between the smallest number in the data set and it's median


Q2: The second quartile is the median of the data set.

Q3: The third quartile is the middle number between the median of the data set and the largest number in that data set.

### Computing Quartile

We will split the data into two halves, lower half and upper half:

If there are an odd number of data points in the original ordered data set, do not include the median (the central value in the ordered list) in either half.

If there are an even number of data points in the original ordered data set, split this data set exactly in half.

The value of the first quartile (Q1) is the median of the lower half and the value of the third quartile (Q3) is the median of the upper half.

### Interquartile range : (Q3 - Q1)


### Expected values : Mean of a dataset.

### variance (sigma^2) : (sum(xi-mu)^2)/n

### Standard Deviation (sigma) : sqrt(variance)
