# Probability 

### Basics
```
P(a) = number of favorable outcome / total number of outcomes
P(a') = 1 - p(a)
```

### Compound events
A compound event is a combination of 2 or more simple events.

If A and B are simple events, then (A Union B) denote the occurance of either A or B.
Similarly, A intersection B, denotes the occurance of A and B together.

### Mutually Exclusive events ( Disjoint events)
A and B are said to be mutually exclusive or disjoint if they have no events in common. (i.e., A intersection B = null and P(A intersection B) = 0)

The probability of any of 2 or more events occurring is the union of events. Because disjoint probabilities have no common events.

### Collectively Exhaustive events
A and B are said to be mutually exhaustive if their union covers all events in the sample spacce.(i.e., A union B = S and P(A union B) = 1)

```
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) [ let A and B are disjoints]
```

### Independent Events
If the outcome of the first event (A) has no impact on the second event (B), then they are considered to be independent (e.g., tossing a fair coin). This brings us to the next fundamental rule of probability: the multiplication rule. It states that if two events,  and , are independent, then the probability of both events is the product of the probabilities for each event.

```
P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)
```
